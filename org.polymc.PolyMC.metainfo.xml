  <description>
    <p>PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity. 
    This is a fork of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made. Read "Why was this fork made?" on the wiki for more details.</p>
